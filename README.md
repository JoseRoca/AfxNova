Windows Framework for FreeBasic

Requires Windows 10 or later.

`AfxNova` is a modern, open‑source Windows framework designed specifically for the **FreeBASIC** programming language. It provides a comprehensive, object‑oriented foundation for building native Win32 and Win64 applications, combining clean abstractions with full access to low‑level Windows APIs when needed. Developed as the next evolutionary step after the **Afx**, `AfxNova` reimagines the architecture with a more consistent design, improved performance, and support for the latest FreeBASIC features.

`AfxNova` bridges the gap between traditional Win32 API programming and higher‑level application development. It allows developers to write Windows applications using a structured, object‑oriented model—without sacrificing the control and efficiency of native API calls.

**Advanced Unicode Support with DWSTRING**

The framework includes `DWSTRING`, a high‑performance, UTF‑16 dynamic string type designed for seamless interaction with Windows APIs.

`DWSTRING` offers:

* Automatic memory management
* Rich text manipulation functions
* Zero‑copy interoperability with Win32 Unicode functions

It is one of the most advanced and efficient Unicode implementations available for **FreeBASIC**.

`AfxNova` targets Windows 32‑bit and 64‑bit exclusively, allowing it to take full advantage of the platform’s capabilities without cross‑platform compromises.

The framework is built using modern FreeBASIC features:

* Namespaces
* Overloaded functions and operators
* Advanced UDTs
* Improved type safety and modularity

This results in cleaner code, better maintainability, and a more intuitive development experience.

`AfxNova` is designed for developers who want:

* A clean, object‑oriented way to build Windows applications
* Full access to native Win32 power without the usual complexity
* A modern, actively maintained framework tailored to FreeBASIC
* A consistent, extensible foundation for GUI and system‑level programming

It is equally suitable for small utilities, large GUI applications, and advanced Windows system tools.
