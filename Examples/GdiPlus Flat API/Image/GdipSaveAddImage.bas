' Creating and Saving a Multiple-Frame Image
'
' With certain file formats, you can save multiple images (frames) to a single file. For
' example, you can save several pages to a single TIFF file. To save the first page, call
' the GdipSaveImageToFile function. To save subsequent pages, call the GdipSaveAddImage
' function.
' The following console application creates a TIFF file with three pages. The images that
' become the pages of the TIFF file come from three disk files. The code first constructs
' three Image objects: multi, page2 and page3. As the individual pages are added to the
' multiImage object, they are also added to the disk file Multiframe.tif.
' Note that the code calls GdipSaveImageToFile (not GdipSaveAddImage) to save the first
' page. The second argument passed to the GdipSaveImageToFile function is the name of the
' disk file that will eventually contain several frames. The third argument passed to the
' GdipSaveImageToFile function specifies the encoder that will be used to convert the data
' in the multiImage object to the format (in this case TIFF) required by the disk file.
' That same encoder is used automatically by all subsequent calls to the GdipSaveAddImage
' function of the multiImage object.
' The fourth argument passed to the GdipSaveImageToFile function is the address of an
' EncoderParameters structure The EncoderParameters structure has an array that contains
' a single EncoderParameter structure. The Guid member of that EncoderParameter structure
' is set to EncoderSaveFlag. The Value member of the EncoderParameter structure points to
' an ULONG variable that contains the value EncoderValueMultiFrame.
' The code saves the second and third pages by calling the GdipSaveAddImage function.
' The first argument passed to the GdipSaveAddImage function is the address of the multi
' object. The second argument is the address of an Image object. The image in that Image
' object is added to the multiImage object and is also added to the Multiframe.tif disk
' file. The third argument passed to the GdipSaveAddImage function is the address of the
' same EncoderParameters structure that was used by the GdipSaveImageToFile function. The
' difference is that the ULONG pointed to by the Value member now contains the value
' EncoderValueFrameDimensionPage. Finally, the file is closed calling the GdipSaveAdd
' function with the Value member of the EncoderParameter structure pointing to a ULONG
' variable that contains the value EncoderValueFlush.
' The main function relies on the helper function GdiPlusGetEncoderClsid to retrieve the
' guid of the TIFF encoder.
