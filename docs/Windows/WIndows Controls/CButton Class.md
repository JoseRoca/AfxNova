# CButton Class

Wrapper static class on top of all the Windows `Button` messages.

A button control is a small, rectangular child window that can be clicked on and off. Buttons can be used alone or in groups and can either be labeled or appear without text. A button typically changes appearance when the user clicks it.

Typical buttons are the check box, radio button, and pushbutton. A `CButton` object can become any of these, based on the button style specified at its initialization by the **AddControl** method of the `CWindow`class.

**Include file**: CButton.inc.

```
#### Remarks

If the button is in a dialog box and the dialog box is not active, the **BM_CLICK** message might fail. To ensure success in this situation, call the **SetActiveWindow** function to activate the dialog box before sending the **BM_CLICK** message to the button.

#### Usage example
```
CButton.Click(hButton)
```
---

### GetIdealSize

Gets the size of the button that best fits its text and image, if an image list is present.

```

FUNCTION GetIdealSize (BYVAL hButton AS HWND) AS SIZE
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *tsize* | A pointer to a **SIZE** structure that receives the desired size of the button, including text and image list, if present. The calling application is responsible for allocating this structure. Set the **cx** and **cy** members to zero to have the ideal height and width returned in the **SIZE** structure. To specify a button width, set the **cx** member to the desired button width. The system will calculate the ideal height for this width and return it in the **cy** member. |

#### Return value

If the message succeeds, it returns TRUE. Otherwise it returns FALSE.

#### Remarks

If no special button width is desired, then you must set both members of **SIZE** to zero to calculate and return the ideal height and width. If the value of the **cx** member is greater than zero, then this value is considered the desired button width, and the ideal height for this width is calculated and returned in the **cy** member.

This message is most applicable to PushButtons. When sent to a PushButton, the message retrieves the bounding rectangle required to display the button's text. Additionally, if the PushButton has an image list, the bounding rectangle is also sized to include the button's image.

When sent to a button of any other type, the size of the control's window rectangle is retrieved.

To use this message, you must provide a manifest specifying Comclt32.dll version 6.0.
