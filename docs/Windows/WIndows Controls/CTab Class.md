# CTab Class

A tab control is analogous to the dividers in a notebook or the labels in a file cabinet. By using a tab control, an application can define multiple pages for the same area of a window or dialog box. Each page consists of a certain type of information or a group of controls that the application displays when the user selects the corresponding tab.

| Parameter | Description |
| ------- | -------------- |
| *hTab* | Handle to the tab control. |
| *iImage* | Zero-based index of the image to remove. |

#### Remarks

The tab control updates each tab's image index, so each tab remains associated with the same image as before. If a tab is using the image being removed, the tab will be set to have no image.

#### Usage example

CTab.RemoveImage(hTab, 2)
```
---

### SetCurFocus

Sets the focus to a specified tab in a tab control.

```
SUB SetCurFocus (BYVAL hTab AS HWND, BYVAL iItem AS LONG)
```

| Parameter | Description |
| ------- | -------------- |
| *hTab* | Handle to the tab control. |
| *iItem* | Zero-based index of the tab that gets the focus. |

#### Remarks

If the tab control has the TCS_BUTTONS style (button mode), the tab with the focus may be different from the selected tab. For example, when a tab is selected, the user can press the arrow keys to set the focus to a different tab without changing the selected tab. In button mode, **SetCurFocus** sets the input focus to the button associated with the specified tab, but it does not change the selected tab.

If the tab control does not have the TCS_BUTTONS style, changing the focus also changes the selected tab. In this case, the tab control sends the TCN_SELCHANGING and TCN_SELCHANGE notification codes to its parent window.

#### Usage example

```
CTab.SetCurFocus(hTab, 2)
```
---

### SetCurSel

| *hTab* | Handle to the tab control. |
| *iItem* | Zero-based index of the tab to select. |

#### Return value

Returns the index of the previously selected tab if successful, or -1 otherwise.

#### Remarks

A tab control does not send a TCN_SELCHANGING or TCN_SELCHANGE notification code when a tab is selected using the TCM_SETCURSEL message.

#### Usage example

```
CTab.SetCurSel(hTab, 2)
```
---

### SetExtendedStyle

```
FUNCTION SetExtendedStyle (BYVAL hTab AS HWND, BYVAL dwExStyle AS DWORD) AS DWORD
```

| Parameter | Description |
| ------- | -------------- |
| *hTab* | Handle to the tab control. |
| *dwExStyle* | Value that contains the new tab control extended styles. |

#### Return value

Returns a DWORD value that contains the previous tab control extended styles.

#### Usage example

```
CTab.SetExtendedStyle(hTab, exStyle)
```
---

### SetImageList

```

| Parameter | Description |
| ------- | -------------- |
| *hTab* | Handle to the tab control. |
| *iItem* | Zero-based index of the item. |
| *pitem* | Pointer to a **TCITEMW** structure that contains the new item attributes. The **mask** member specifies which attributes to set. If the mask member specifies the LVIF_TEXT value, the *pszText* member is the address of a null-terminated string and the *cchTextMax* member is ignored. |
| *item* | A **TCITEMW** structure that contains the new item attributes. The **mask** member specifies which attributes to set. If the mask member specifies the LVIF_TEXT value, the *pszText* member is the address of a null-terminated string and the *cchTextMax* member is ignored. |

| Parameter | Description |
| ------- | -------------- |
| *hTab* | Handle to the tab control. |
| *cb* | Number of extra bytes. |

#### Return value

Returns TRUE if successful, or FALSE otherwise.

#### Remarks

By default, the number of extra bytes is four. An application that changes the number of extra bytes cannot use the **TCITEMW** structure to retrieve and set the application-defined data for a tab. Instead, you must define a new structure that consists of the **TCITEMHEADER** structure followed by application-defined members.

An application should only change the number of extra bytes when a tab control does not contain any tabs.
