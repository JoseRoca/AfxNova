# CAdoEvents class

The `CAdoEvents` class serves as a comprehensive event-handling interface for ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) within the AfxNova framework. It is designed to intercept and respond to a wide range of ADO operations, offering developers fine-grained control over database interactions at runtime.

This class encapsulates both **Connection** events and **Recordset** events, enabling developers to monitor and manipulate the behavior of ADO objects during critical operations such as connecting to a data source, executing commands, navigating records, and modifying data. Each event method provides access to relevant parameters and status flags, allowing for custom logic to be injected before or after the underlying ADO operation.

For example, the **WillMove** event is triggered just before the current position in a Recordset changes, giving developers a chance to validate or cancel the move operation based on business rules or application state.

Whether you're building robust data-driven applications or need to enforce strict transactional workflows, `CAdoEvents` offers the hooks necessary to make your ADO interactions both intelligent and responsive.

####Usage example

```
#include once "AfxNova/CADODB.inc"
USING AfxNova

' // === Create an instance of the Connection object
DIM pConnection AS CAdoConnection
' // === Connect events
DIM pEvtSink AS ANY PTR = NEW CAdoConnectionEvents
pConnection.SetEvents pEvtSink
' // === Open the connection
pConnection.Open("Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=biblio.mdb")

' // === Create a Recordset object
DIM pRecordset AS CAdoRecordset
' // === Connect events
pEvtSink = NEW CAdoRecordsetEvents
pRecordset.SetEvents pEvtSink
' // === Open the recordset
pRecordset.Open("SELECT * FROM Authors", pConnection, adOpenKeyset, adLockOptimistic, adCmdText)

' // === Parse the recordset
' // While not at the end of the recordset...
DO WHILE NOT pRecordset.EOF
   ' // Get the content of the "Author" column
   PRINT pRecordset.Collect("Author")
   ' // Fetch the next row
   IF pRecordset.MoveNext <> S_OK THEN EXIT DO
LOOP

' // === Close the recordset and the connection
' // If you don't close them, they will be closed when the application ends
pRecordset.Close
pConnection.Close
```

```
FUNCTION WillConnect (BYVAL ConnectionString AS Afx_BSTR PTR, BYVAL UserID AS Afx_BSTR PTR, _
   BYVAL Password AS Afx_BSTR PTR, BYVAL Options AS LONG PTR, BYVAL adStatus AS EventStatusEnum PTR, _
   BYVAL pConnection AS Afx_ADOConnection PTR) AS HRESULT
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *ConnectionString* | A BSTR that contains connection information for the pending connection. |
| *UserID* | A BSTR that contains a user name for the pending connection. |
| *Password* | A BSTR that contains a password for the pending connection. |
| *Options* | A Long value that indicates how the provider should evaluate the *ConnectionString*. Your only option is *adAsyncOpen*. |
| *adStatus* | *EventStatusEnum*. When this event is called, this parameter is set to *adStatusOK* by default. It is set to *adStatusCantDeny* if the event cannot request cancellation of the pending operation.Before this event returns, set this parameter to *adStatusUnwantedEvent* to prevent subsequent notifications. Set this parameter to *adStatusCancel* to request the connection operation that caused cancellation of this notification. |
| *pConnection* | The **Connection** object for which this event notification applies. Changes to the parameters of the **Connection** by the **WillConnect** event handler will have no effect on the **Connection**. |

#### Remarks

When **WillConnect** is called, the *ConnectionString*, *UserID*, *Password*, and *Options* parameters are set to the values established by the operation that caused this event (the pending connection), and can be changed before the event returns. WillConnect may return a request that the pending connection be canceled.

When this event is canceled, **ConnectComplete** will be called with its *adStatus* parameter set to *adStatusErrorsOccurred*.

---

## ConnectComplete

The **ConnectComplete** event is called after a connection starts.

| ---------- | ----------- |
| *pError* | An **Error** object. It describes the error that occurred if the value of *EventStatusEnum* is *adStatusErrorsOccurred*; otherwise, it is not set. |
| *adStatus* | *EventStatusEnum*. When **ConnectComplete** is called, this parameter is set to *adStatusCancel* if a **WillConnect** event has requested cancellation of the pending connection. Before either event returns, set this parameter to *adStatusUnwantedEvent* to prevent subsequent notifications. However, closing and reopening the **Connection** causes these events to occur again. |
| *pConnection* | The **Connection** object that fired the event. |

---

## Disconnect

| *Options* | A Long value that indicates options that can be used to execute the command or open the **Recordset**. |
| *adStatus* | *EventStatusEnum*. Before this event returns, set this parameter to *adStatusUnwantedEvent* to prevent subsequent notifications, or *adStatusCancel* to request cancellation of the operation that caused this event. |
| *pCommand* | The **Command** object for which this event notification applies. |
| *pRecordset* | The **Recordset** object for which this event notification applies. |
| *pConnection* | The **Connection** object for which this event notification applies. |

#### Remarks

A **WillExecute** event may occur due to a **Connection.Execute**, **Command.Execute**, or **Recordset.Open** method The *pConnection* parameter should always contain a valid reference to a **Connection** object. If the event is due to **Connection.Execute**, the *pRecordset* and *pCommand* parameters are set to Nothing. If the event is due to Recordset.Open, the pRecordset parameter will reference the Recordset object and the pCommand parameter is set to NULL. If the event is due to **Command.Execute**, the *pCommand* parameter will reference the **Command** object and the *pRecordset* parameter is set to NULL.

**WillExecute** allows you to examine and modify the pending execution parameters. This event may return a request that the pending command be canceled.

| *pCommand* | The **Command** object that was executed. Contains a **Command** object even when calling **Connection.Execute** or **Recordset.Open** without explicitly creating a **Command**, in which cases the **Command** object is created internally by ADO. |
| *pRecordset* | A **Recordset** object that is the result of the executed command. This **Recordset** may be empty. You should never destroy this **Recordset** object from within this event handler. Doing so will result in an Access Violation when ADO tries to access an object that no longer exists. |
| *pConnection* | A **Connection** object. The connection over which the operation was executed. |

* MoveNext
* MovePrevious
* AddNew
* Requery

These events may occur because of the following properties:

* Filter
* Index

* AbsolutePosition

These events also occur if a child Recordset has **Recordset** events connected and the parent **Recordset** is moved.

You must set the *adStatus* parameter to *adStatusUnwantedEvent* for each possible *adReason* value in order to completely stop event notification for any event that includes an *adReason* parameter.

---

These events also occur if a child Recordset has **Recordset** events connected and the parent **Recordset** is moved.

You must set the *adStatus* parameter to *adStatusUnwantedEvent* for each possible *adReason* value in order to completely stop event notification for any event that includes an *adReason* parameter.

---

## EndOfRecordset

| *pRecordset* | A **Recordset** object. The **Recordset** for which this event occurred. |

#### Remarks

An **EndOfRecordset** event may occur if the **MoveNext** operation fails.

This event handler is called when an attempt is made to move past the end of the **Recordset** object, perhaps as a result of calling **MoveNext**. However, while in this event, you could retrieve more records from a database and append them to the end of the **Recordset**. In that case, set *fMoreData* to VARIANT_TRUE, and return from **EndOfRecordset**. Then call **MoveNext** again to access the newly retrieved records.

---

## FetchProgress
