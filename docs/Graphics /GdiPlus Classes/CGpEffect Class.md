# CGpEffect Class

The `GpEffect` class serves as a base class for eleven classes that you can use to apply effects and adjustments to bitmaps. The following classes descend from Effect.

* CGpBlur
* CGpSharpen
* CGpTint
* CGpRedEyeCorrection
* CGpColorMatrixEffect
* CGpColorLUT
* CGpBrightnessContrast
* CGpHueSaturationLightness
* CGpColorBalance
* CGpLevels
* CGpColorCurve

To apply and effect to a bitmap, create an instance of one of the descendants of the `CGpEffect` class, and pass the address of that descendant to the **DrawImage** method of the CGGraphics class or to the **ApplyEffect** method of the **CGpBitmal** class.

**Inherits from**: CGpBase.<br>
**Include file**: CGpEffect.inc.

### Methods

| Name       | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| [Constructor](#constructor) | Creates an instance of the **CGpEffect** class. |
| [GetAuxData](#getauxdata) | Gets a pointer to a set of lookup tables created by a previous call to the **ApplyEffect** method of the `CGpBitmap` class. |
| [GetAuxDataSize](#getauxdatasize) | Gets the size, in bytes, of the auxiliary data created by a previous call to the **ApplyEffect** method of the `CGpBitmap` class. |
| [GetParameterSize](#getparametersize) | Gets the total size, in bytes, of the parameters currently set for this Effect. The **GetParameterSize** method is usually called on an object that is an instance of a descendant of the `CGpEffect` class. |
| [UseAuxDara](#useauxdata) | Sets or clears a flag that specifies whether the **ApplyEffect** method of the `CGpBitmap`class should return a pointer to the auxiliary data that it creates. |
