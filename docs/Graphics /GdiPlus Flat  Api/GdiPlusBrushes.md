# Brush Functions

A **Brush** object is used to paint the interior of graphics shapes, such as rectangles, ellipses, pies, polygons, and paths.

### Generic Brush Functions

| Name       | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| [GdipCloneBrush](#gdipclonebrush) | Creates a new **Brush** object based on this brush. |
| [GdipDeleteBrush](#gdipdeletebrush) | Deletes the specified **Brush** object. |
| [GdipGetBrushType](#gdipgetbrushtype) | Gets the type of this brush. |

### SolidBrush Functions

| Name       | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| [GdipCreateSolidFill](#gdipcreatesolidfill) | Creates a **SolidBrush** object based on a color. |
| [GdipGetSolidFillColor](#gdipgetsolidfillcolor) | Gets the color of this **SolidBrush** object. |
| [GdipSetSolidFillColor](#gdipsetsolidfillcolor) | Sets the color of this **SolidBrush** object. |

### HatchBrush Functions

An **HatchBrush** defines a rectangular brush with a hatch style, a foreground color, and a background color. There are six hatch styles. The foreground color defines the color of the hatch lines; the background color defines the color over which the hatch lines are drawn.


| Name       | Description |

## GdipCloneBrush

Creates a new **Brush** object based on this brush. The cloned brush is a deep copyâ€”you can modify it without affecting the original.

```
FUNCTION GdipCloneBrush (BYVAL brush AS GpBrush PTR, BYVAL cloneBrush AS GpBrush PTR PTR) AS GpStatus
```
| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *brush* | [in] Pointer to the **Brush** object created with **GdipCreateSolidFil**, **GdipCreateHatchBrush**, **GdipCloneBrush** or similar function. |
| *cloneBrush* | [out] Pointer to a **Brush** object variable that recives a pointer to the new **Brush** object. |

#### Example

The following example creates a SolidBrush object, clones it, and then uses the clone to fill a rectangle.

```
' ========================================================================================
SUB Example_CloneBrush (BYVAL hdc AS HDC)

   Dim ryRatio AS SINGLE = dpiY / 96
   ' // Set the scale transform
   hStatus = GdipScaleWorldTransform(graphics, rxRatio, ryRatio, MatrixOrderPrepend)

   ' // Create an ARGB color
   DIM pixelColor AS ARGB
   pixelColor = GDIP_ARGB(255, 255, 0, 0)

   ' // Create a SolidBrush
   DIM brush AS GpBrush PTR
   hStatus = GdipCreateSolidFill(pixelColor, @brush)

   IF cloneBrush THEN GdipDeleteBrush(cloneBrush)
   IF brush THEN GdipDeleteBrush(brush)
   IF graphics THEN GdipDeleteGraphics(graphics)

END SUB
' ========================================================================================
```
---

## GdipDeleteBrush

Deletes the specified **Brush** object.

```
FUNCTION GdipDeleteBrush (BYVAL brush AS GpBrush PTR) AS GpStatus
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *brush* | [in] Pointer to the **Brush** object created with **GdipCreateSolidFil**, **GdipCreateHatchBrush**, **GdipCloneBrush** or similar function. |

#### Example

```
DIM hStatus AS LONG

' // Create a graphics object from the device context
DIM graphics AS GpGraphics PTR
hStatus = GdipCreateFromHDC(hdc, @graphics)

' // Create a SolidBrush
DIM brush AS GpSolidFill PTR
hStatus = GdipCreateSolidFill(ARGB_BLUE, @brush)

' ...
' ...
' ...

' // Cleanup
IF brush THEN GdipDeleteBrush(brush)
IF graphics THEN GdipDeleteGraphics(graphics)
```
---

## GdipGetBrushType

Gets the type of this brush.

```
FUNCTION GdipGetBrushType (BYVAL brush AS GpBrush PTR, BYVAL brushType AS GpBrushType PTR) AS GpStatus
```
| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *brush* | [in] Pointer to the **Brush** object created with **GdipCreateSolidFil**, **GdipCreateHatchBrush**, **GdipCloneBrush** or similar function. |
| *brushType* | [out] Pointer to a *GpBrushType* variable that receives the type of this brush. The value returned is one of the elements of the *BrushType* enumeration. |

**BrushType enumeration**

| Constant  | Value | Description |
| --------- | ----- | ----------- |
| **BrushTypeSolidColor** | 0 | Indicates a brush of type **SolidBrush**. A solid brush paints a single, constant color that can be opaque or transparent. |
| **BrushTypeHatchFill** | 1 | Indicates a brush of type **HatchBrush**. A hatch brush paints a background and paints, over that ackground, a pattern of lines, dots, dashes, squares, crosshatch, or some variation of these. The hatch brush consists of two olors: one for the background and one for the pattern over the background. The color of the background is called the background olor, and the color of the pattern is called the foreground color. |
| **BrushTypeTextureFill** | 2 | Indicates a brush of type **TextureBrush**. A texture brush paints an image. The image or texture is either a portion of a specified image or a scaled version of a specified image. The type of image (metafile or nonmetafile) determines whether the texture is a ortion of the image or a scaled version of the image. |
| **BrushTypePathGradient** | 3 | Indicates a brush of type **PathGradientBrush**. A path gradient brush paints a color gradient in which the color changes from a enter point outward to a boundary that is defined by a closed curve or path. The color gradient has one color at the center point and ne or multiple colors at the boundary. |
| **BrushTypeLinearGradient** | 4 | Indicates a brush of type **LinearGradientBrush**. A linear gradient brush paints a color gradient in which the color changes evenly rom the starting boundary line of the linear gradient brush to the ending boundary line of the linear gradient brush. The boundary ines of a linear gradient brush are two parallel straight lines. The color gradient is perpendicular to the boundary lines of the inear gradient brush, changing gradually across the stroke from the starting boundary line to the ending boundary line. The color radient has one color at the starting boundary line and another color at the ending boundary line. |
