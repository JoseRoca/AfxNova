## GdipBeginContainer

Begins a new graphics container.

```
FUNCTION GdipBeginContainer (BYVAL graphics AS GpGraphics PTR, BYVAL dstrect AS GpRectF PTR, _
   BYVAL srcrect AS GpRectF PTR, BYVAL unit AS GpUnit, BYVAL state AS GraphicsContainer PTR) AS GpStatus
```
```
FUNCTION GdipBeginContainerI (BYVAL graphics AS GpGraphics PTR, BYVAL dstrect AS GpRect PTR, _
   BYVAL srcrect AS GpRect PTR, BYVAL unit AS GpUnit, BYVAL state AS GraphicsContainer PTR) AS GpStatus
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *graphics* | [in] Pointer to the **Graphics** object. |
| *dstrect* | [in] Reference to a rectangle that, together with *srcrect*, specifies a transformation for the container. |
| *srcrect* | [in] Reference to a rectangle that, together with *dstrect*, specifies a transformation for the container. |
| *unit* | [in] Unit of measure for the container. |
| *state* | [out] Pointer to a **GraphicsContainer** object variable that receives a value that identifies the container. |

#### Remarks

Use this function to create nested graphics containers. Graphics containers are used to retain graphics state, such as transformations, clipping regions, and various rendering properties.

The **GdipBeginContainer** function returns a value of type **GraphicsContainer**. When you have finished using a container, pass that value to the **GdipEndContainer** function.

When you call the **GdipBeginContainer** function, an information block that holds the state of the **Graphics** object is put on a stack. The **GdipBeginContainer** function returns a value that identifies that information block. When you pass the identifying value to the **GdipEndContainer** function, the information block is removed from the stack and is used to restore the **Graphics** object to the state it was in at the time of the **GdipBeginContainer** call.

Containers can be nested; that is, you can call the *GdipBeginContainer** function several times before you call the **GdipEndContainer** function. Each time you call the **GdipBeginContainer** function, an information block is put on the stack, and you receive an identifier for the information block. When you pass one of those identifiers to the **GdipEndContainer** function, the **Graphics** object is returned to the state it was in at the time of the **GdipBeginContainer** call that returned that particular identifier. The information block placed on the stack by that **GdipBeginContainer** call is removed from the stack, and all information blocks placed on that stack after that **GdipBeginContainer** call are also removed.

Calls to the **GdipSaveGraphics** function place information blocks on the same stack as calls to the **GdipBeginContainer** function. Just as an **GdipEndContainer** call is paired with a **GdipBeginContainer** call, a **GdipRestoreGraphics** call is paired with a **GdipSaveGraphics** call.

**Caution**: When you call **GdipEndContainer**, all information blocks placed on the stack (by **GdipSaveGraphics** or by **GdipBeginContainer**) after the corresponding call to **GdipBeginContainerare** removed from the stack. Likewise, when you call **GdipRestoreGraphics**, all information blocks placed on the stack (by **GdipSaveGraphics** or by **GdipBeginContainer**) after the corresponding call to **GdipSaveGraphics** are removed from the stack.

## GdipCreateHalftonePalette

Gets a Windows halftone palette.

```
FUNCTION GdipCreateHalftonePalette () AS HPALETTE
```

#### Return value

Returns a handle to a Windows halftone palette.

#### Remarks

The purpose of the **GdipCreateHalftonePalette** function is to enable GDI+ to produce a better quality halftone when the display uses 8 bits per pixel. To display an image using the halftone palette, use the following procedure:

1. Call **GdipCreateHalftonePalette** to get a GDI+ halftone palette.
2. Select the halftone palette into a device context.
3. Realize the palette by calling the **RealizePalette** function.
4. Construct a **Graphics** object from a handle to the device context.
5. Call one of the **GdipDrawImage** functions of the **Graphics** object.

Be sure to delete the palette when you have finished using it. If you do not follow the preceding procedure, then on an 8-bits-per-pixel-display device, the default, 16-color process is used, which results in a lesser quality halftone.

#### Example

```
' ========================================================================================

' time, the code gets a halftone palette, selects the palette into a device context, and
' realizes the palette.

## GdipDrawBeziers

Draws a sequence of connected Bezier splines.

```
FUNCTION GdipDrawBeziers (BYVAL graphics AS GpGraphics PTR, BYVAL pen AS GpPen PTR, _
   BYVAL points AS GpPointF PTR, BYVAL count AS INT_) AS GpStatus
```
```
FUNCTION GdipDrawBeziersI (BYVAL graphics AS GpGraphics PTR, BYVAL pen AS GpPen PTR, _
   BYVAL points AS GpPoint PTR, BYVAL count AS INT_) AS GpStatus
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *graphics* | [in] Pointer to the **Graphics** object. |
| *pen* | [in] Pointer to a pen that is used to draw the Bezier splines. |
| *points* | Pointer to an array of **GpPoint** objects that specify the starting, ending, and control points of the Bezier splines. The ending coordinate of one Bezier spline is the starting coordinate of the next Bezier spline. |
| *count* | [in] Number of elements in the *points* array. |

#### Remarks

A Bezier spline does not pass through its control points. The control points act as magnets, pulling the curve in certain directions to influence the way the Bezier splines bend.

#### Example

## GdipEndContainer

Closes a graphics container that was previously opened by the **GdipBeginContainer** method.

```
FUNCTION GdipEndContainer (BYVAL graphics AS GpGraphics PTR, _
   BYVAL state AS GraphicsContainer PTR) AS GpStatus
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *graphics* | [in] Pointer to the **Graphics** object. |
| *state* | [in] Value (previously returned by **GdipBeginContainer**) that identifies the container to be closed. |

#### Remarks

When you call the **GdipBeginContainer** function, an information block that holds the state of the **Graphics** object is put on a stack. The **GdipBeginContainer** method returns a value that identifies that information block. When you pass the identifying value to the **GdipEndContainer** method, the information block is removed from the stack and is used to restore the **Graphics** object to the state it was in at the time of the GdipBeginContainer call.

Containers can be nested; that is, you can call the **GdipBeginContainer** function several times before you call the **GdipEndContainer** function. Each time you call the **GdipBeginContainer** function, an information block is put on the stack, and you receive an identifier for the information block. When you pass one of those identifiers to the **GdipEndContainer** function, the **Graphics** object is returned to the state it was in at the time of the **GdipBeginContainer** call that returned that particular identifier. The information block placed on the stack by that **GdipBeginContainer** call is removed from the stack, and all information blocks placed on that stack after that **GdipBeginContainer** call are also removed.

Calls to the **GdipSaveGraphics** function place information blocks on the same stack as calls to the **GdipBeginContainer** function. Just as an **GdipEndContainer** call is paired with a **GdipBeginContainer** call, a **GdipRestoreGraphics** call is paired with a **GdipSaveGraphics** call.

Caution When you call **GdipEndContainer**, all information blocks placed on the stack (by **GdipSaveGraphics** or by **GdipBeginContainer**) after the corresponding call to **GdipBeginContainer** are removed from the stack. Likewise, when you call **GdipRestoreGraphics**, all information blocks placed on the stack (by **GdipSaveGraphics** or by **GdipBeginContainer**) after the corresponding call to **GdipSaveGraphics** are removed from the stack.

```
FUNCTION GdipGetClipBounds (BYVAL graphics AS GpGraphics PTR, BYVAL rect AS GpRectF PTR) AS GpStatus
```
```
FUNCTION GdipGetClipBoundsI (BYVAL graphics AS GpGraphics PTR, BYVAL rect AS GpRect PTR) AS GpStatus
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *graphics* | [in] Pointer to the **Graphics** object. |
| *rect* | [out] Pointer to a **GpRect** structure that receives the rectangle that encloses the clipping region. |

#### Remarks

The world transformation is applied to the clipping region and then the enclosing rectangle is calculated.

If you do not explicitly set the clipping region of a **Graphics** object, its clipping region is infinite. When the clipping region is infinite, **GdipGetClipBounds** returns a large rectangle. The *x* and *y* data members of that rectangle are large negative numbers, and the *width* and *heigh* data members are large positive numbers.

#### Example

```
' ========================================================================================
' The following example sets a clipping region, gets the rectangle that encloses the
' clipping region, and then fills the rectangle.

## GdipGetCompositingMode

Gets the compositing mode currently set for the **Graphics** object.

```
FUNCTION GdipGetCompositingMode (BYVAL graphics AS GpGraphics PTR, _
   BYVAL compositingMode AS CompositingMode PTR) AS GpStatus
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *graphics* | [in] Pointer to the **Graphics** object. |
| *compositingMode* | [out] Pointer to a variable that receives the compositing mode currently set for the **Graphics** object. |

#### Remarks

Suppose you create a **GpSolidBrush** object based on a color that has an alpha component of 192, which is about 75 percent of 255. If your **Graphics** object has its compositing mode set to **CompositingModeSourceOver**, then areas filled with the solid brush are a blend that is 75 percent brush color and 25 percent background color. If your **Graphics** object has its compositing mode set to **CompositingModeSourceCopy**, then the background color is not blended with the brush color. However, the color rendered by the brush has an intensity that is 75 percent of what it would be if the alpha component were 255.

#### Example

```
' ========================================================================================
' The following example creates a Graphics object and sets its compositing mode to
' CompositingModeSourceCopy. The code creates a SolidBrush object based on a color with an
' alpha component of 128. The code passes the address of that brush to the GdipFillRectangle
' function to fill a rectangle with a color that is not blended with the background color.
' The call to the GdipSetCompositingMode function demonstrates how to obtain the compositing
' mode (which is already known in this case). The code determines whether the compositing
' mode is CompositingModeSourceCopy and if so, changes it to CompositingModeSourceOver.
' Then the code calls GdipFillRectangle a second time to fill a rectangle with a color that
' is a half-and-half blend of the brush color and the background color.

## GdipGetDC

Gets a handle to the device context associated with the **Graphics** object.

```
FUNCTION GdipGetDC (BYVAL graphics AS GpGraphics PTR, BYVAL hdc AS HDC PTR) AS GpStatus
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *graphics* | [in] Pointer to the **Graphics** object. |
| *hdc* | [out] Handle to the device context associated with the **Graphics** object. |

#### Remarks

Each call to the **GdipGetDC** fujnction should be paired with a call to the **GdipReleaseDC** function. Do not call any **Graphics** functions between the calls to **GdipGetDC** and **GdipReleaseDC**. If you attempt to call a **Graphics** function between **GdipGetDC** and **GdipReleaseDC**, the method will fail and will return *ObjectBusy*.

Any state changes you make to the device context between **GdipGetDC** and **GdipReleaseDC** will be ignored by GDI+ and will not be reflected in rendering done by GDI+.

' ========================================================================================

' of graphics commands and then saves the recorded commands in a file named MetafileTest.emf.
' Note that the function that creates the metafile (GdipRecordMetafileFileName) receives a
' device context handle, and we retrieve a Graphics handle calling the GdipGetImageGraphicsContext
' function passing the metafile handle. The recording stops (and the recorded commands are
' saved to the file) when the Graphics handle is deleted with GdipDeleteGraphics. To display
' the metafile, a new Graphics handle is retrieved calling the GdipCreateFromHDC function
' and passing the Graphics and Metafile handles to the GdipDrawImage function. Note that
' the code uses the same Metafile handle to record and to display (play back) the metafile.
' A metafile contains its own graphics state, which is defined by the Graphics object used
' to record the metafile. Any properties of the Graphics object (clip region, world
' transformation, smoothing mode, and the like) that you set while recording the metafile
' will be stored in the metafile. When you display the metafile, the drawing will be done

## GdipRestoreGraphics

Sets the state of the **Graphics** object to the state stored by a previous call to the **GdipSaveGraphics** function.

```
FUNCTION GdipRestoreGraphics (BYVAL graphics AS GpGraphics PTR, _
   BYVAL state AS GraphicsState) AS GpStatus
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *graphics* | [in] Pointer to the **Graphics** object. |
| *state* | [in] 32-bit value (returned by a previous call to the **GdipSaveGraphics** function) that identifies a block of saved state. |

#### Remarks

When you call the **GdipSaveGraphics** function, an information block that holds the state of the **Graphics** object is put on a stack. The **GdipSaveGraphics** function returns a value that identifies that information block. When you pass the identifying value to the **GdipRestoreGraphics** method, the information block is removed from the stack and is used to restore the **Graphics** object to the state it was in at the time of the **GdipSaveGraphics** call. Note that the identifier returned by a given call to the **GdipSaveGraphics** function can be passed only once to the **GdipRestoreGraphics** function.

Calls to the **GdipSaveGraphics** function can be nested; that is, you can call the **GdipSaveGraphics** function several times before you call the **GdipRestoreGraphics** function. Each time you call the **GdipSaveGraphics** function, an information block is put on the stack, and you receive an identifier for the information block. When you pass one of those identifiers to the **GdipRestoreGraphics** function, the **Graphics** object is returned to the state it was in at the time of the **GdipSaveGraphics** call that returned that particular identifier. The information block placed on the stack by that **GdipSaveGraphics** call is removed from the stack, and all information blocks placed on that stack after that **GdipSaveGraphics** call are also removed.

Calls to the **GdipBeginContainer** function place information blocks on the same stack as calls to the **GdipSaveGraphics** function. Just as a **GdipRestoreGraphics** call is paired with a **GdipSaveGraphics** call, an **GdipEndContainer** call is paired with a **GdipBeginContainer** call.

Caution When you call **GdipRestoreGraphics**, all information blocks placed on the stack (by **GdipRestoreGraphics** or by **GdipBeginContainer**) after the corresponding call to **GdipSaveGraphics** are removed from the stack. Likewise, When you call **GdipEndContainer**, all information blocks placed on the stack (by **GdipSaveGraphics** or by **GdipBeginContainer**) after the corresponding call to **GdipBeginContainer** are removed from the stack.

#### Example

```
' ========================================================================================
' Restoring Only the First of Two Nested Saved States
' The following example sets the world transformation of a Graphics object to a rotation and
' then saves the state of the Graphics object. Next, the code calls GdipTranslateWorldTransform,
' and saves the state again. Then the code calls ScaleTransform. At that point, the world
' transformation of the Graphics object is a composite transformation: first rotate, then
' translate, then scale. The code uses a red pen to draw an ellipse that is transformed by
' that composite transformation.
' The code passes state1, which was returned by the first call to Save, to the GdipRestoreGraphics
' function, and draws the ellipse again using a green pen. The green ellipse is rotated but
' not translated or scaled.
' Next the code attempts to restore the state identified by state2. The attempt fails because
' the call GdipRestoreGraphics(state1) removed the information blocks identified by both
' state1 and state2 from the stack.

## GdipSaveGraphics

Saves the current state (transformations, clipping region, and quality settings) of a **Graphics** object. You can restore the state later by calling the **GdipRestoreGraphics** function.

```
FUNCTION GdipSaveGraphics (BYVAL graphics AS GpGraphics PTR, BYVAL state AS GraphicsState PTR) AS GpStatus
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *graphics* | [in] Pointer to the **Graphics** object. |
| *state* | [out] A value that identifies the saved state. Pass this value to the **GdipRestoreGraphics** function when you want to restore the state. |

#### Remarks

When you call the **GdipSaveGraphics** function, an information block that holds the state of the **Graphics** object is put on a stack. The **GdipSaveGraphics** function returns a value that identifies that information block. When you pass the identifying value to the **GdipRestoreGraphics** function, the information block is removed from the stack and is used to restore the **Graphics** object to the state it was in at the time of the **GdipSaveGraphics** call. Note that the identifier returned by a given call to the **GdipSaveGraphics** function can be passed only once to the **GdipRestoreGraphics** function.

Calls to the **GdipSaveGraphics** function can be nested; that is, you can call the **GdipSaveGraphics** function several times before you call the **GdipRestoreGraphics** function. Each time you call the **GdipSaveGraphics** function, an information block is put on the stack, and you receive an identifier for the information block. When you pass one of those identifiers to the **GdipRestoreGraphics** function, the **Graphics** object is returned to the state it was in at the time of the **GdipSaveGraphics** call that returned that particular identifier. The information block placed on the stack by that **GdipSaveGraphics** call is removed from the stack, and all information blocks placed on that stack after that **GdipSaveGraphics** call are also removed.

Calls to the **GdipBeginContainer** function place information blocks on the same stack as calls to the **GdipSaveGraphics** function. Just as a **GdipRestoreGraphics** call is paired with a **GdipSaveGraphics** call, an **GdipEndContainer** call is paired with a **GdipBeginContainer** call.

Caution When you call **GdipRestoreGraphics**, all information blocks placed on the stack (by **GdipSaveGraphics** or by **GdipBeginContainer**) after the corresponding call to **GdipSaveGraphics** are removed from the stack. Likewise, When you call **GdipEndContainer**, all information blocks placed on the stack (by **GdipSaveGraphics** or by **GdipBeginContainer**) after the corresponding call to **GdipBeginContainer** are removed from the stack.

## GdipSetCompositingMode

Sets the compositing mode of the **Graphics** object.

```
FUNCTION GdipSetCompositingMode (BYVAL graphics AS GpGraphics PTR, _
    BYVAL combineMode AS CombineMode) AS GpStatus
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *graphics* | [in] Pointer to the **Graphics** object. |
| *combineMode* | [in] Element of the **CompositingMode** enumeration that specifies the compositing mode. |

####  Remarks

Suppose you create a **SolidBrush** object based on a color that has an alpha component of 192, which is about 75 percent of 255. If your Graphics object has its compositing mode set to *CompositingModeSourceOver*, then areas filled with the solid brush are a blend that is 75 percent brush color and 25 percent background color. If your **Graphics** object has its compositing mode set to *CompositingModeSourceCopy*, then the background color is not blended with the brush color. However, the color rendered by the brush has an intensity that is 75 percent of what it would be if the alpha component were 255.

You cannot use *CompositingModeSourceCopy* along with *TextRenderingHintClearTypeGridFit*.

#### Example

```
' ========================================================================================
' The following example creates a Graphics object and sets its compositing mode to
' CompositingModeSourceOver. The code creates a solid brush based on a color that has an
' alpha component of 128. The code passes the address of that brush to the GdipFillRectangle
' function to fill a rectangle with a color that is a half-and-half blend of the brush color
' and the background color. Then the code sets the compositing mode of the Graphics object
' to CompositingModeSourceCopy and fills a second rectangle with the same brush. In that
' second rectangle, the brush color is not blended with the background color.

## GdipSetMetafileDownLevelRasterizationLimit

Sets the resolution for certain brush bitmaps that are stored in this metafile.

```
FUNCTION GdipSetMetafileDownLevelRasterizationLimit (BYVAL metafile AS GpMetafile PTR, _
    BYVAL metafileRasterizationLimitDpi AS UINT) AS GpStatus
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *metafile* | [in] Pointer to the **Metafile** object. |
| *metafileRasterizationLimitDpi* | [in] Non-negative long integer value that specifies the resolution in dots per inch (dpi). If you set this parameter equal to 0, the resolution is set to match the resolution of the device context handle that was passed to the Metafile constructor. If you set this parameter to a value greater than 0 but less than 10, the resolution is left unchanged. |

#### Remarks

The purpose of this method is to prevent metafiles from becoming too large as a result of texture and gradient brushes being stored at high resolution. Suppose you construct a **Metafile** object (for recording an *EmfTypeEmfOnly* metafile) based on the device context of a printer that has a resolution of 600 dpi. Also suppose you create a path gradient brush or a texture brush based on a **Bitmap** object that has a resolution of 96 dpi. If the bitmap that represents that brush is stored in the metafile with a resolution of 96 dpi, it will require much less space than if it is stored with a resolution of 600 dpi.

The default rasterization limit for metafiles is 96 dpi. So if you do not call this method at all, path gradient brush and texture brush bitmaps are stored with a resolution of 96 dpi.

The rasterization limit has an effect on metafiles of type *EmfTypeEmfOnly* and *EmfTypeEmfPlusDual*, but it has no effect on metafiles of type *EmfTypeEmfPlusOnly*.

### Example

## GdipSetPageScale

Sets the scaling factor for the page transformation of the **Graphics** object. The page transformation converts page coordinates to device coordinates.

```
FUNCTION GdipSetPageScale (BYVAL graphics AS GpGraphics PTR, BYVAL scale AS REAL) AS GpStatus
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *graphics* | [in] Pointer to the **Graphics** object. |
| *scale* | [in] The scaling factor. |

#### Remarks

**GdipSetPageUnit** changes the measurement unit (e.g., inches, millimeters).

**GdipSetPageScale** applies a scaling factor to that unit.

**GdipGetPageScale** retrieves the current scale factor, which affects how coordinates are transformed from page units to device units.

This is particularly useful when you're preparing content for printing or want consistent layout across devices with different DPI settings.

#### Example

```

         BYVAL positions AS CONST GpPointF PTR, BYVAL flags AS INT_, _
         BYVAL matrix AS CONST GpMatrix PTR) AS GpStatus
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *graphics* | [in] Pointer to the **Graphics** object. |
| *text* | [in] Pointer to an array of 16-bit values. If the *DriverStringOptionsCmapLookup* flag is set, each value specifies a Unicode character to be displayed. Otherwise, each value specifies an index to a font glyph that defines a character to be displayed. |
| *length* | [in] Long integer value that specifies the number of values in the text array. The length parameter can be set to 1 if the string is null terminated. |
| *font* | [in] Pointer to a **Font** object that specifies the family name, size, and style of the font that is to be applied to the string. |
| *brush* | [in] Pointer to a **Brush** object that is used to fill the string. |
| *positions* | [in] If the *DriverStringOptionsRealizedAdvance* flag is set, positions is a pointer to a **GpPointF** structure that specifies the position of the first glyph. Otherwise, positions is an array of **GpPointF** structures, each of which specifies the origin of an individual glyph. |
| *flags* | [in] Long integer value  that specifies the options for the appearance of the string. This value must be an element of the *DriverStringOptions* enumeration or the result of a bitwise **OR** applied to two or more of these elements. |
| *matrix* | [in] Pointer to a **Matrix** object that specifies the transformation matrix to apply to each value in the text array. |

#### Example

```
' ========================================================================================
' GdipDrawDriverString is a GDI+ function that draws individual characters at precise
' positions, giving you full control over glyph placement and rendering. Unlike GdipDrawString,
' which handles layout automatically, this method lets you:
' - Specify each character as a Unicode value or glyph index.
' - Define exact coordinates for each glyph.
' - Apply custom transformations via a matrix.
' - Use flags to control layout behavior (e.g. advance spacing or cmap lookup).
' It’s ideal for advanced text rendering scenarios like custom typesetting, vertical text,
' or non-standard scripts where layout precision is critical.

#### Example

```
' ========================================================================================
' The following example defines three ranges of character positions within a string and
' sets those ranges in a StringFormat object. Next, the MeasureCharacterRanges method is
' used to get the three regions of the display that are occupied by the characters that
' are specified by the ranges. This is done for three different layout rectangles to show
' how the regions change according to the layout of the string. Also, on the third repetition
' of this, the string format flags are changed so that the regions measured will include
' trailing spaces.

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *graphics* | [in] Pointer to the **Graphics** object. |
| *text* | [in] Pointer to an array of 16-bit values. If the *DriverStringOptionsCmapLookup* flag is set, each value specifies a Unicode character to be displayed. Otherwise, each value specifies an index to a font glyph that defines a character to be displayed. |
| *length* | [in] Long integer value that specifies the number of values in the text array. The length parameter can be set to 1 if the string is null terminated. |
| *font* | [in] Pointer to a **Font** object that specifies the family name, size, and style of the font to be applied to the string. |
| *positions* | [in] If the *DriverStringOptionsRealizedAdvance* flag is set, positions is a pointer to a **GpPointF** structure that specifies the position of the first glyph. Otherwise, positions is an array of PointF objects, each of which specifies the origin of an individual glyph. |
| *flags* | [in] Long integer value that specifies the options for the appearance of the string. This value must be an element of the *DriverStringOptions* enumeration or the result of a bitwise **OR** applied to two or more of these elements. |
| *matrix* | [in] Pointer to a **Matrix** object that specifies the transformation matrix to apply to each value in the text array. |
| *boundingBox* | [out] Pointer to a **GpRectF** structure that receives the rectangle that bounds the string. |
