## PathIterator Functions

The **PathIterator** functions allow to isolate selected subsets of the path stored in a **GraphicsPath** object. A path consists of one or more figures. You can use a **GraphicsPathIterator** to isolate one or more of those figures. A path can also have markers that divide the path into sections. You can use a **GraphicsPathIterator** object to isolate one or more of those sections.

## GdipPathIterHasCurve

Determines whether the path has any curves.

```
FUNCTION GdipPathIterHasCurve (BYVAL iterator AS GpPathIterator PTR, BYVAL hasCurve AS BOOL PTR) AS GpStatus
```

| Parameter  | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| *iterator* | [in] Pointer to the **GraphicsPathIterator** object. |
| *hasCurve* | [out] Pointer to a variable that receives the number of data points in the path. |

#### Remarks

All curves in a path are stored as sequences of BÃ©zier splines. For example, when you add an ellipse to a path, you specify the upper-left corner, the width, and the height of the ellipse's bounding rectangle. Those numbers (upper-left corner, width, and height) are not stored in the path; instead; the ellipse is converted to a sequence of four Bzier splines. The path stores the endpoints and control points of those BÃ©zier splines.

A path stores an array of data points, each of which belongs to a line or a BÃ©zier spline. If some of the points in the array belong to BÃ©zier splines, then **GdipPathHasCurve returns** TRUE. If all points in the array belong to lines, then  **GdipPathHasCurve** returns FALSE.

Certain methods flatten a path, which means that all the curves in the path are converted to sequences of lines. After a path has been flattened, **GdipPathHasCurve** will always return FALSE. Flattening happens when you call the **GdipFlattenPath**, **GdipWidenPath**, or **GdipWarpPath** functions.

#### Example

```
' ========================================================================================
' Example: Using GdipPathIterHasCurve to Detect BÃ©zier Segments.
' Paths with curves are stored as BÃ©zier splines.
' Some operations (like flattening or widening) convert curves to straight lines.
' This check helps you decide whether to preserve or simplify the path.
